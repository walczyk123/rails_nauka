Excercises for toy app

* CSS id for text "User was syccessfuly created" -> id="notice"  

* new user without mail? -> no problem, created withoud mail  

* new user with invalid adress -> created with shitty mail  

* destroying all of users -> 1) "Are you sure?" 2) "user was succesfully destroyed"  

Excercises for toy app user actions:  

* @users variable was defined when user panel was open. Then, when edit was pressed, you get redirect to user edit view. Edit view (edit.html.erb) shows 1- editing user, 2- shows @user data, 3 is button that shows particular user view, 4 is link to users list.  

* cant find line in scaffolding  , YET!

* user edit view is edit.html.erb
